### AWS IAM Access Key and PGP Key Configuration for Users

The provided code block defines several resources within AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage user access and security for IAM users.

**IAM Access Key**

The `aws_iam_access_key` resource creates an IAM access key for an IAM user, providing an alternative credential for accessing AWS resources.

* `user`: Specifies the IAM user for which the access key is created.
* `depends_on`: Indicates that the creation of this resource depends on the successful creation of the corresponding IAM user resource.

**PGP Key for Login**

The `pgp_key` resource defines a PGP key for an IAM user to enhance login security.

* `name`: Assigns a name to the PGP key.
* `email`: Specifies the email address associated with the PGP key.
* `comment`: Adds a descriptive comment for the PGP key.

**IAM User Login Profile with PGP Key**

The `aws_iam_user_login_profile` resource configures the login profile for an IAM user, utilizing the PGP key for added security.

* `user`: Identifies the IAM user to which the login profile belongs.
* `pgp_key`: Sets the PGP key to be used for login.
* `password_reset_required`: Indicates whether the user is required to reset their password after the initial login.
* `depends_on`: Declares that the creation of this resource depends on the existence of the corresponding IAM user resource and PGP key resource.

**Decrypting Encrypted Password**

The `data` block defines a `pgp_decrypt` data source to decrypt the encrypted password associated with the IAM user's login profile.

* `ciphertext`: Specifies the encrypted password retrieved from the IAM user's login profile resource.
* `ciphertext_encoding`: Indicates that the ciphertext is encoded in the specified format.
* `private_key`: Supplies the private key to decrypt the ciphertext.
