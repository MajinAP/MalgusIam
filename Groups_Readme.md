# IAM Groups

IAM groups are a fundamental aspect of IAM resource management, allowing you to organize and manage IAM users based on their roles and responsibilities within the AWS infrastructure. Your project utilizes four IAM groups: `administrators`, `management`, `DevOps`, and `contractors`.

### Administrators Group

**Name:** `aws_iam_group.administrator`

The `aws_iam_group.administrator` group holds the highest level of privilege within the IAM hierarchy. Members of this group possess unrestricted access to all AWS resources, granting them supreme control over the infrastructure. This group should be reserved for individuals with the utmost level of trust and responsibility, ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data and critical functions.

### Management Group

**Name:** `aws_iam_group.management`

The `aws_iam_group.management` group encompasses individuals responsible for overseeing and managing AWS resources without the absolute authority of the administrators group. Members of this group have permissions related to billing, `EC2` instances, `Cognito` identity, and AWS organizations. This group is suitable for individuals who need to manage day-to-day operations and maintain overall control over the infrastructure.

### DevOps Group

**Name:** `aws_iam_group.devops`

The `aws_iam_group.devops` group comprises DevOps practitioners responsible for maintaining and developing the AWS infrastructure. Members of this group have permissions to describe the organization and obtain information about `EC2` instances. These permissions allow them to monitor the infrastructure, identify potential issues, and perform necessary maintenance tasks.

### Contractor Group

**Name:** `aws_iam_group.contractor`

The `aws_iam_group.contractor` group includes individuals engaged as contractors for specific projects or tasks. Members of this group have permissions to describe `S3` resources, enabling them to access the necessary data and perform their assigned tasks without compromising overall security.

By employing IAM groups, your project effectively segregates access privileges based on the specific requirements of each group. This approach ensures that only authorized users have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, maintaining a secure and controlled environment while enabling efficient resource management.
