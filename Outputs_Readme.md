### Disclaimer

This code snippet is intended for illustrative purposes only and should not be used in a production environment. It demonstrates the concept of managing user credentials using outputs but does not implement all necessary security measures for real-world applications. For production environments, it is crucial to employ robust security practices, including proper user authentication, access management, and encryption techniques. Additionally, sensitive information such as access keys, passwords, and account IDs should never be embedded directly in code or scripts. Always store and handle sensitive data securely to safeguard your AWS infrastructure.

Please feel free to modify the code as needed to suit your specific requirements.

## Understanding the Code Outputs (Ex. Darth Sidious)

The provided code defines several outputs that encapsulate and expose sensitive information related to Darth Sidious's AWS credentials. These outputs are intended to be used in other parts of your infrastructure or shared with authorized personnel.

### Credentials Output

The `credentials` output provides a structured object containing Darth Sidious's access key ID, secret access key, and decrypted password. This output is marked as sensitive, indicating that it should be treated with the utmost care and not embedded directly into code or scripts.

- **Key:** Represents Darth Sidious's access key ID, used to identify the access key when making API calls.
- **Secret:** Contains Darth Sidious's secret access key, a crucial component for authenticating API requests.
- **Password:** Holds Darth Sidious's decrypted login password, which is necessary for logging into the AWS Management Console.



### Username Output

The `username` output simply extracts the username for Darth Sidious from the `local.users` configuration map. This output provides a convenient way to access the username without directly embedding it in the code.

### Password Output

The `password` output exposes the decrypted login password for Darth Sidious. Similar to the `credentials` output, this information should be treated with extreme caution and not embedded in code.

### Console Link Output

The `console_link` output provides a direct link to the AWS Management Console, allowing authorized users to access and manage AWS resources through the web interface.

### Reason for Account ID Prompt

Prompting for the account ID serves as a security measure to prevent accidental exposure of the account ID within the code itself. By prompting for this value, the code ensures that the account ID is not embedded directly in the code, reducing the risk of sensitive information being inadvertently disclosed.

### Summary

In summary, the outputs defined in your code provide a secure and organized way to manage and access user credentials for AWS resources. The use of outputs promotes code reusability and security by encapsulating sensitive information and preventing its direct embedding in the code.
